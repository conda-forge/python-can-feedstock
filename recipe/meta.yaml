  summary: 'The can package provides controller area network support for Python developers '
  description: |
    The **C**\ ontroller **A**\ rea **N**\ etwork is a bus standard designed
    to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other. It
    has priority based bus arbitration and reliable deterministic
    communication. It is used in cars, trucks, boats, wheelchairs and more.

    The ``can`` package provides controller area network support for
    Python developers; providing common abstractions to
    different hardware devices, and a suite of utilities for sending and receiving
    messages on a can bus.

    The library currently supports CPython as well as PyPy and runs on Mac, Linux and Windows.
